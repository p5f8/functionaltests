## Notes

- goto is to structured programming what assignment is to functional programming.  

- Higher-order functions  
  We can pass function to function  
  We can create function within function  
  We can return function from function  

- Functions have to be pure  

- Pure functions don't have side-effects:  
  
  1. Does not change anything    
  2. Does not depend on anything that changes  
  3.
